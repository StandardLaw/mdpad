# This is a test of JavaScript MD pages

## Basic code blocks


```js 
a = [1,4,5,6]
```

Here's another entry:

```js
b = 99.99 * a[1]
```

```js
println(android);
println(city);
println(sex);
print(name1);
print(name1);
println();
println(true);
println(name1);
println(name1);
```

```js output=markdown
println(android);
print(name1);
print(name1);
println();
println(name1);
println(name1);
```

## Form elements

You can also enter form inputs using a Markdown
[extension](https://github.com/brikis98/wmd). Here are some examples

name1 = ___(# Tom *hi* <b>hello</b>)

sex = (x) male () female

phones = [] Android [x] iPhone [x] Blackberry

city = {BOS, SFO, (NYC)}

Each of the form labels above (`name`, `sex`, and `city`) can be used as JavaScript
variables. Here is a simple example:
